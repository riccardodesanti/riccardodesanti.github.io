During my Bachelor I have started my research journey in Reinforcement Learning with prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdgxRiEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Marcello Restelli</a> at <a href="https://www.polimi.it" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Politecnico di Milano</a>. Afterwards, I have done visitings at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a>, and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>, both times under the supervision of profs. <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michael Bronstein</a> and Marcello Restelli. My research has been recently awarded with an <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2022/oral/16290" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Outstanding Paper Award at ICML 2022</a>.</p> <h2 id="research-interests">research interests</h2> <p>I am broadly interested in the foundations of algorithmic decision-making and its applications in automatic scientific discovery. This spans a wide spectrum of areas including:</p> <ul> <li>Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Reinforcement/Active Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Bandits)</li> <li>Optimal Experimental Design</li> <li>Combinatorial and Non-Convex Optimization</li> <li>Causality and Geometric Machine Learning</li> </ul> <p>I strive to design reliable algorithms with guarantees leading to theoretical understanding of the underlying problems as well as relevant for real world applications mostly related with digital chemistry, including molecular Design, drug discovery, and experimental design in chemical spaces.</p> </body></html>
