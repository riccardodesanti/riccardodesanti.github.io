I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch). I am lucky to be advised by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) ([Learning and Adaptive Systems](https://las.inf.ethz.ch) group), [Niao He](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/niaohe) ([Optimization and Decision Intelligence](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch) group), and [Kjell Jorner](https://chab.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/a-z/person-detail.MzA4MDE4.U2VxdWVuY2UvMTM1LC0yMTMwMTkyODAz.html) ([Digital Chemistry Laboratory](https://dcl.ethz.ch)). I am also part of the [Institute of Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch) at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html). During my Bachelor I have started my research journey in Reinforcement Learning with prof. [Marcello Restelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdgxRiEAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it). Afterwards, during a MS in Machine Learning and Theoretical CS at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/de.html), I have done visitings at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) and [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk), both times under the supervision of profs. [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) and Marcello Restelli. <br>
My research has been recently awarded with an [Outstanding Paper Award at ICML 2022](https://icml.cc/virtual/2022/oral/16290).

## research interests
I am broadly interested in the foundations of **algorithmic decision-making** and its applications in **automatic scientific discovery**. This spans a wide spectrum of areas including:


- Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Reinforcement/Active Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Bandits)
- Optimal Experimental Design
- Submodular and Non-Convex Optimization
- Causality and Geometric Machine Learning

I strive to design reliable algorithms with guarantees leading to theoretical understanding of the underlying problems as well as relevant for real world applications mostly related with digital chemistry, including molecular design, drug discovery, and experimental design in chemical spaces.
