I am a doctoral researcher at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch), Zurich. At [ETH](https://ethz.ch/de.html), I am lucky to be advised by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea), [Niao He](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/niaohe), and [Kjell Jorner](https://chab.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/a-z/person-detail.MzA4MDE4.U2VxdWVuY2UvMTM1LC0yMTMwMTkyODAz.html). I am part of the [Institute of Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch), [Learning and Adaptive Systems group](https://las.inf.ethz.ch), Optimization and Decision Intelligence group (https://odi.inf.ethz.ch), and affiliated with the [Digital Chemistry Laboratory](https://dcl.ethz.ch). During my Bachelor I have started my research journey in Reinforcement Learning with prof. [Marcello Restelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdgxRiEAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it). Afterwards, I have done a visiting at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), and [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk), both times under the supervision of profs. [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) and Marcello Restelli.

## research interests
I am broadly interested in the foundations of algorithmic decision-making and its applications in automatic scientific discovery. This spans a wide spectrum of areas including:


- Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Reinforcement/Active Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Bandits)
- Experimental Design
- Combinatorial Optimization
- Geometric Machine Learning

I strive to design reliable algorithms with guarantees leading to theoretical understanding of the underlying problems as well as relevant for real world applications mostly related with Digital Chemistry, including Molecular Design, Drug Discovery, and experimental design in chemical spaces.
