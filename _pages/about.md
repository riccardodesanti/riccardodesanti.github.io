I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch), advised by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch), [Niao He](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch), and [Kjell Jorner](https://dcl.ethz.ch), and affiliated with the [Institute of Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch) and [NCCR Catalysis](https://www.nccr-catalysis.ch). My research focuses on **optimization and exploration via generative models** — bridging decision-making under uncertainty, optimization and generative modeling to tackle fundamental challenges in large-scale scientific discovery. 
<!-- 
I aim to tackle generative discovery in a full-stack manner: from mathematical and algorithmic foundations, to scalable methods and real-world applications inincluding [molecules and enzyme design for sustainable chemistry](https://www.nccr-catalysis.ch/research/approach/).

Before this, I worked on unsupervised exploration in RL, earning an [Outstanding Paper Award at ICML](https://icml.cc/virtual/2022/oral/16290) with [Marcello Restelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdgxRiEAAAAJ&hl=en), and completed research visits at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) and [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk) with [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/).

## research interests
I aim to tackle generative discovery in a full-stack manner — from mathematical and algorithmic foundations, to scalable learning methods, and real-world applications including [molecules and enzyme design for sustainable chemistry](https://www.nccr-catalysis.ch/research/approach/). To this end, my work typically draws on the following areas:

- Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Reinforcement/Active Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Bandits)
- Generative Modeling (Diffusion and Flow Matching models)
- Optimization (Convex, Submodular, on Probability Spaces)
- Stochastic Optimal Control
