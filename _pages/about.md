I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch), advised by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch), [Niao He](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch), and [Kjell Jorner](https://dcl.ethz.ch), and affiliated with the [Institute of Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch) and [NCCR Catalysis](https://www.nccr-catalysis.ch). My research focuses on generative optimization and exploration â€” combining decision-making, optimization and generative modeling to tackle fundamental challenges in large-scale scientific discovery.

Before this, I worked on unsupervised exploration in RL, earning an [Outstanding Paper Award at ICML 2022](https://icml.cc/virtual/2022/oral/16290) while supervised by [Marcello Restelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdgxRiEAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it) during my BSc, and completed research visits at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London under [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) during my MSc.


## research interests
I am broadly interested in the foundations of **algorithmic decision-making** and its applications in **automatic scientific discovery**. This spans a wide spectrum of areas including:


- Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Reinforcement/Active Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Bandits)
- Optimal Experimental Design
- Submodular and Non-Convex Optimization
- Causality and Geometric Machine Learning

I strive to design reliable algorithms with guarantees leading to theoretical understanding of the underlying problems as well as relevant for real world applications mostly related with digital chemistry, including molecular design, drug discovery, and experimental design in chemical spaces.
