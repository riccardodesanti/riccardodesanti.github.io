I am a MSc student at ETH Zurich majoring in Machine Learning and Theoretical CS. During my Bachelor I have started my research journey in Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) supervised by prof. Marcello Restelli at Politecnico di Milano. Currently, I am doing a visiting at the University of Oxford, while last year I was at Imperial College London, both times under the supervision of profs. Michael Bronstein and Marcello Restelli.

## research interests
I am interested in the interface of RL/Active Learning, Theoretical CS (e.g. Optimization, Information Theory, Algorithmic Game Theory), and other areas such as Causality and Group Theory, whereas my application areas of interest are mostly Scientific Discovery and Healthcare. Recently, I have been trying to strengthen the theory bridging sequential decision making under uncertainty, causality, and group theoretic learning, in order to tackle generalization and exploration issues through efficient algorithms with guarantees.
